# updatedPortfolio

Welcome to my updated portfolio. I recommend you view my github repo https://github.com/Itsacoup/MattBaberResponsivePortfolio as it is my original portfolio and i kept the theme and most of the images and text content, just updated it with portfolio items and links.



Things i focused on.

-Writing JavaScript for the page, adding dynamic and animated content. 

-Images and appropriate display of projects.

-Clean and sharp layout including modern icon links.



Things that need to be worked on/bugs

-giving functionality to email form.

-making mobile responsive. (ran out of time to work on that)

-adjusting the mouse event overlay for the carousel

-cleaning up element place/edges


Thanks you for checking it out.
